# In python, data type is apply to memmory and not to variable name.
# variable name ka data type nahi hota,
# but memory mein ke andar jo reference hai uska data type hota hai.
  
# eg:-  x = 10, so 10 in the memory will have number has a data type.

a = 5
print(a)    # 5       
b = 2
print(b)    # 2

a = a + b
print(a)   # 7


# python behaves differently with numbers,string and list,sets,dict.
